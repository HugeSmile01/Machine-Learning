## 🚀 Getting Started

### Live Demo
Visit the live application at: [https://hugesmile01.github.io/Machine-Learning/](https://hugesmile01.github.io/Machine-Learning/)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HugeSmile01/Machine-Learning.git
   cd Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:
   ```bash
   # Using Python's built-in server
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Or using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Visit** `http://localhost:8000`

## 📖 How to Use

### Step 1: Choose a Model
Select from three types of machine learning models:
- Image Classification
- Linear Regression
- Neural Network

### Step 2: Upload Data
- Drag and drop your data files
- Or use the provided sample datasets to get started quickly
- Supports: CSV, JSON, images (JPG, PNG)

### Step 3: Configure Training
Adjust training parameters:
- **Epochs**: Number of training iterations (default: 50)
- **Learning Rate**: How fast the model learns (default: 0.01)
- **Batch Size**: Samples processed per update (default: 32)

### Step 4: Train
Click "Start Training" and watch:
- Real-time progress updates
- Loss and accuracy metrics
- Training charts
- Educational insights

### Step 5: Test
Once training completes:
- Test your model with new data
- View predictions and confidence levels
- Understand the results

## 📊 Sample Datasets

The platform includes built-in sample datasets:

- **Linear Regression**: 100 data points with linear relationship (y = 2x + 1 + noise)
- **Classification**: 200 data points for binary classification
- **Image Data**: 50 sample patterns for image classification

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding Machine Learning
Machine learning enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. The model identifies patterns and makes predictions based on examples.

### Training Process
1. **Initialization**: Model starts with random parameters
2. **Forward Pass**: Model makes predictions
3. **Loss Calculation**: Measures prediction errors
4. **Backpropagation**: Adjusts parameters to reduce errors
5. **Iteration**: Repeats for multiple epochs

### Key Metrics
- **Loss**: Measures prediction error (lower is better)
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions (higher is better)
- **Epoch**: One complete pass through the training dataset
- **Learning Rate**: Controls the step size during optimization

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+
- ⚠️ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile) - Limited performance

## 📱 Responsive Design

The platform is fully responsive and works on:
- 💻 Desktop computers
- 📱 Tablets
- 📱 Smartphones

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Client-side only**: All processing happens in the browser
- **No backend required**: Perfect for GitHub Pages
- **TensorFlow.js**: Hardware-accelerated ML in JavaScript
- **WebGL**: GPU acceleration for faster training

### Performance
- Uses WebGL backend for GPU acceleration when available
- Efficient memory management with tensor disposal
- Optimized for real-time training visualization
