# Deployment Guide for GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Quick Deployment

This project is ready to deploy to GitHub Pages! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Branch: `copilot/add-machine-learning-ai` (or `main` after merging)
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment

- GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
- This usually takes 1-3 minutes
- You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

### Step 3: Access Your Site

Your site will be available at:
```
https://hugesmile01.github.io/Machine-Learning/
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:

1. Add a `CNAME` file with your domain name
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Update the `start_url` in `manifest.json`

### Environment Check

Before deploying, ensure:
- ✅ All files are committed
- ✅ No build errors in the code
- ✅ External CDN libraries are accessible
- ✅ Paths are relative (not absolute)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading

1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
2. Verify the correct branch is selected
3. Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
4. Check browser console for errors

### CDN Libraries Not Loading

The app uses these CDN libraries:
- TensorFlow.js: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@4.11.0/dist/tf.min.js`
- Chart.js: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.js`

If they fail to load:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a different browser
3. Check if jsdelivr.net is accessible

### Styling Issues

- Clear browser cache
- Check for CSS file path issues
- Verify `styles.css` is in the same directory as `index.html`

### JavaScript Errors

- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for error messages
- Verify TensorFlow.js loaded successfully
- Try in a different browser

## 📱 Testing on Different Devices

After deployment, test on:
- 💻 Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- 📱 Mobile devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- 📱 Tablets

## 🔄 Updating the Site

To update the deployed site:

1. Make changes to your files
2. Commit and push to the branch:

   git commit -m "Your update message"
   git push origin copilot/add-machine-learning-ai
   ```
3. GitHub will automatically redeploy (1-3 minutes)

## 📊 Analytics (Optional)
