# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose a Model
Select one of three ML models:
- **Image Classification** - For image recognition tasks
- **Linear Regression** - For numerical predictions
- **Neural Network** - For complex classification

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Load Data
Either:
- Upload your own data files (CSV, JSON, images)
- Use built-in sample datasets

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Train & Test
- Configure parameters (epochs, learning rate)
- Click "Start Training"
- Watch the model learn in real-time
- Test with new data

## Training Parameters Explained

### Epochs
- **What**: Number of complete passes through the dataset
- **Default**: 50
- **Tip**: More epochs = more learning (but risk overfitting)

### Learning Rate
- **What**: How fast the model adjusts
- **Default**: 0.01
- **Tip**: Too high = unstable, too low = slow learning

### Batch Size
- **What**: Samples processed before updating
- **Default**: 32
- **Tip**: Larger = faster but needs more memory

## Understanding Metrics

### Loss
- Measures prediction error
- **Goal**: Get it as low as possible
- Decreases during successful training

### Accuracy
- Percentage of correct predictions
- **Goal**: Get it as high as possible
- Should increase during training

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with sample data** to understand the workflow
2. **Use default parameters** for your first training
3. **Watch the insights** to learn what's happening
4. **Try different models** with the same data
5. **Experiment with parameters** to see their effects

## Troubleshooting

### Training is slow
- Reduce batch size
- Reduce number of epochs
- Use a more powerful device

### Poor accuracy
- More training epochs
- Better quality data
- Try a different model type

### Model not learning (loss not decreasing)
- Adjust learning rate
- Check data quality
- Try more epochs
